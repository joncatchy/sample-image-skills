# Google Vision Box Skill
Use [Google Vision](https://cloud.google.com/vision/) to automatically extract metadata from a clothing retailer catalog picture and add the metadata to content managed in Box.

## Usage
## Prerequisites
* [Install Node.js (we recommend v8.0 or above)](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Install Serverless](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Set up a Google Cloud account](https://cloud.google.com/)
Sign up for a [Box Developer](https://developer.box.com/) account and prepare your app for Box skills. See our [developer documentation](https://developer.box.com/docs/box-skills) for more guidance.

## Configuring Serverless
To create and manage our Box Skill, we'll use the [Serverless framework](https://serverless.com/). This framework allows for deployment to various serverless platforms.
To use Serverless, install the NPM module.
```
npm install -g serverless
```
Next, follow our guide on configuring [Serverless for Google Cloud](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/google/guide/quick-start/), or any of the guides on [serverless.com](https://serverless.com/) to allow deploying to your favorite serverless provider.

Clone this repo and change into the folder.
```
git clone https://github.com/box-community/sample-image-skills
cd sample-image-skills/cloud-vision-label-detection
```
Next, you'll need to update your crednetials in the `serverless.yml`. 
```
provider:
  name: google
  runtime: nodejs8
  project: hip-river-225020
  # the path to the credentials file needs to be absolute
  credentials: ~/path/to/your/credentials.json
```

Finally, deploy the Skill.
```
serverless deploy -v
```

At the end of this, you will have an invocation URL for your serverless function.

## Set the invocation URL
The final step is to configure your Box Skill with the invocation URL for your serverless function. You should have received this in the previous, after you deployed the function for the first time.
Once your new Skill is called by our code, the Skill usually takes a few minutes to process and write the new metadata to the file.
